# Credit

All credit goes to the University of Wisconsin for the format of this homework assignment and the survey questions below.

# Setup and Review

This repo contains code for the password validator. The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

## Did you find the JavaScript Learning Tutor useful? If so, what about the tool made it useful? If not, why not?
> I don't know what that is.


## Do you have any suggestions on how the JavaScript Learning Tutor might be improved?
> 


## Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!).
> I had to google basic functions and how to do things I have never had exposure to like linux which horrifically complicated this. 


## Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
> 5


## On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment?
> 8. The emotional response would've been ten, but that's unfair. There just seemed to be a high learning curve involved.


## Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better?
> The instructions said you don't need linux, but the in class instructions and word instructions use linux. I was confused about alot of this and didn't feel like I actually did anything.
